<H1 ALIGN=MIDDLE> PHILOSOPHY</H1>
<B><I><H2>Goldcrest High believes in providing children with an environment that integrates individual and group, learning and playing, knowledge and values, 
reasoning and creativity, together with discipline and freedom - into a seamless mix of experiences, discoveries, and excitement.
<BR>
Goldcrest High is designed to be a true centre of learning, a place where students enjoy the thrill of learning something new each day. 
Here learning is not an imposition, interference, a theft of freedom - but an excitement, and the key to a greater freedom than they have ever known.
<BR>
Inspired by Rabindranath Tagore’s vision for an educated community, Goldcrest High imbibes the spirit of creativity and co-curricular excellence 
that complements the academic learning beautifully. Goldcrest High aims at providing an education that promotes intellectual freedom, 
teaches children to live in harmony and to appreciate the diversity of our cultures and communities.</B></I></H2>
