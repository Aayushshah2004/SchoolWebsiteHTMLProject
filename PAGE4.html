<H1 ALIGN=MIDDLE>MEANING OF AGNI</H1><I>
<H3>Agni means fire, and connotes the Vedic fire god of Hinduism Agni also refers to one of the guardian deities of direction<BR>, who is typically found in southeast corners of Hindu temples In classical cosmology of Indian religions<BR>, Agni as fire has been one of the five inert impermanent constituents (Dhatus) along with space (Akasa), water (Ap),<BR> air (Vayu) and earth (Prithvi), the five combining to form the empirically perceived material existence (Prakriti). <BR><BR>
In the Vedic literature, Agni is a major and oft invoked god along with Indra and Soma. Agni is considered as the mouth <BR>of the gods and goddesses, and the medium that conveys offerings to them in a homa (votive ritual) He is conceptualized in<BR> ancient Hindu texts to exist at three levels, on earth as fire, in atmosphere as lightning, and in the sky as sun.<BR> This triple presence connects him as the messenger between gods and human beings in the Vedic thought<BR><BR>

The relative importance of Agni declined in the post-Vedic era, as he was internalize and his identity evolved to metaphorically <BR>represent all transformative energy and knowledge in the Upanishads and later Hindu literature. Agni remains an integral part<BR> of Hindu traditions, such as being the central witness of the rite-of-passage ritual in traditional Hindu weddings called Saptapadi<BR> or Agnipradakshinam (seven steps and mutual vows), as well being part of Diya (lamp) in festivals such as Diwali and Aarti in Puja.</I></H3>
